## About me

Balancing the roles of a young mother and a software developer,
<br /><br />
I find fulfillment in both nurturing my family and creating innovative solutions in the tech world. 
<br /><br />
Beyond coding, my heart finds solace in the tranquility of yoga and meditation.
<br /><br />
Embracing mindfulness practices allows me to find peace amidst lifeâ€™s hustle and bustle.
<br /><br />
Nature is my sanctuary, and I cherish every moment spent outdoors, whether itâ€™s hiking through lush forests or simply basking in the beauty of a sunset. 
<br /><br />
My passion for healing plants runs deep, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring their therapeutic properties and incorporating them into my daily life. 
<br /><br />
From herbal teas to aromatic oils, natureâ€™s remedies never cease to amaze me. Life is a journey, and Iâ€™m grateful for every experience it brings. 
<br /><br />
