## About me

I find fulfillment in both nurturing my family and creating innovative solutions in the tech world. 
<br /><br />
Beyond coding, my heart finds solace in the tranquility of yoga and meditation.
<br /><br />
Embracing mindfulness practices allows me to find peace amidst life’s hustle and bustle.
<br /><br />
Nature is my sanctuary, and I cherish every moment spent outdoors, whether it’s hiking through lush forests or simply basking in the beauty of a sunset. 
<br /><br />
My passion for healing plants runs deep, and I’m constantly exploring their therapeutic properties and incorporating them into my daily life. 
<br /><br />
From herbal teas to aromatic oils, nature’s remedies never cease to amaze me. Life is a journey, and I’m grateful for every experience it brings. 
<br /><br />
