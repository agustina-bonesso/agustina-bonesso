## About me

Balancing the roles of a young mother and a software developer,
I find fulfillment in both nurturing my family and creating innovative solutions in the tech world. 
Beyond coding, my heart finds solace in the tranquility of yoga and meditation.
Embracing mindfulness practices allows me to find peace amidst lifeâ€™s hustle and bustle.
Nature is my sanctuary, and I cherish every moment spent outdoors, whether itâ€™s hiking through lush forests or simply basking in the beauty of a sunset. 
My passion for healing plants runs deep, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring their therapeutic properties and incorporating them into my daily life. 
From herbal teas to aromatic oils, natureâ€™s remedies never cease to amaze me. Life is a journey, and Iâ€™m grateful for every experience it brings. 
If you share a love for technology, mindfulness, and the wonders of nature,
