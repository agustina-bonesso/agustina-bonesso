Hi there! I'm Agustina,

a software developer originally from the picturesque city of Mendoza, Argentina, 
now happily residing in vibrant Hamburg, Germany. Balancing the roles of a young mother and a software developer,
I find fulfillment in both nurturing my family and creating innovative solutions in the tech world. 
Beyond coding, my heart finds solace in the tranquility of yoga and meditation.
Embracing mindfulness practices allows me to find peace amidst life’s hustle and bustle.
Nature is my sanctuary, and I cherish every moment spent outdoors, whether it’s hiking through lush forests or simply basking in the beauty of a sunset. 
My passion for healing plants runs deep, and I’m constantly exploring their therapeutic properties and incorporating them into my daily life. 
From herbal teas to aromatic oils, nature’s remedies never cease to amaze me. Life is a journey, and I’m grateful for every experience it brings. 
If you share a love for technology, mindfulness, and the wonders of nature,

I’d love to connect and share stories! Feel free to adjust any details to better reflect your personality and interests!
